                <p>
                    Iris Benado studied Architecture at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem and continued her Architecture and Design Studies at Pratt Institute in New York where she received her BA and MA degrees in 1994. She is also a graduate of the Long Island Feng Sui Institute in New York.<br/><br/>
                    Between 1994 and 1999 Iris worked at the prestigious architectural firm of Rafael Vi√±oly in Manhattan. In 1999 she established her own architecture and design firm in New York where she designed houses and apartments. After living for 20 years in the US, Iris returned to Israel where she continues to work in her Tel-Aviv studio. In 2009 Iris was invited to join the Open University where she continues to teach Interior Design until today.<br/><br/>
                    The Studio is a boutique studio specializing in private houses, apartments, offices and show rooms. It follows a unique design process by approaching all elements and components of the project as a whole.<br/><br/>
                    From the architectural plans to the selection of textile selection and the styling of the space we believe that a better understanding of the client and a close relationship are the key to a successful result.<br/><br/>
                    Everyone has a style. We help our clients find theirs, stick to it and make it uniquely their own.<br/>
                    We strongly believe in designs that respect the past, create the present and look forward to the future.
